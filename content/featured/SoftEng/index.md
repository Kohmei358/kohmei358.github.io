A JavaFX application for use by [Brigham and Women's Hospital](https://www.brighamandwomens.org/) patients, employees, and administrators created for WPI's Software Engineering (CS3733) class. I used Agile Scrum methodology to lead a 11 person team to take this project from requirements gathering to user testing.
