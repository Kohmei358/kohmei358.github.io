A renewable energy feasibility study that considered guest perceptions, staff opinion, and the renewable energy generation potential of YMCA at Estes Park, CO. Based on the results of surveys, interviews, and on-site measurements, we ruled out wind and micro-hydro generation. We ranked campus buildings by solar efficiency and recommended three plans to implement solar at varying scales.
